            <br>
            <br> It could be said that "A Step" was my first actual touch with filmmaking - the whole thing that starts
            from a solid idea to exporting a "film" from an editing software.
            <br> It was adapted from my real experience after starting my life in Canada. The film didn't change the
            silence and awkwardness until after it was presented in our school's theater.
            <br> After watching it with my fist clenched and toes gripping the floor, I voluntarily went onto the stage
            to join the improv in the following drama class, for the first time in my life.
            <br> I forgot what I had played in that section of "freeze", all I remembered was the steady and peaceful
            pace of my steps on the way back to my seat.
            <br> I wasn't feeling excited or proud. I guess I was just more relaxed, like feeling the frozenness in my
            body quietly melted away.
            <br> I am still not a big fan of improv games.
