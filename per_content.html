                <br>
                <br> The script was completed in one night and the following morning.
                <br> It was originally adapted from Xitong's real relationship with her younger sister.
                <br> The original play I wrote myself was one about motherhood, but Xitong suggested changing it into
                one about siblinghood, which I excitedly agreed on.
                <br> As a single child in my family, siblinghood is always a subject that I am extremely curious about
                and wanting to explore, but also feeling that it might be something that I'd never feel and understand
                in my real life.
                <br> This play kind of gave me a touch of siblinghood and I felt more grown-up after playing it.
                <br> I see it as a elder sister that once happened to appear in my life. Even just for maybe a few
                moments.
                <br> I am deeply touched when hearing the audience in the talk-back said "I am the elder sister in my
                family but finally there's someone who'd hugged me." I am more than glad to see that the theatre I
                created actually embraced the space and its people.
                <br> It was the second show of the "I Do<del>n't</del> Care" (Duology).

                    <br>
                    <br> The story is adapted from my dad's real working experience as a police officer back around 2000
                    in my hometown.
                    <br> One of the writing task at the Belfry workshop was writing about "contrasting characters" and I
                    was assigned to write about "cop and criminal".
                    <br> Therefore I heard the real version of this story from my dad and was deeply touched by the
                    relationship between the protagonist and his neighbor gradma. (It was "he" originally).
                    <br> Writing started without any purpose after the workshop was done and it continued with pure joy
                    and without overthinking.
                    <br> Ultimately, I see this story as a story of "Mei" (the teenage girl) and "Qi" (the female
                    officer), instead of either a story of "good and evil", or a story of "cop and criminal", which I
                    think is important when interpreting it.
                    <br> It was the first show of the "I Do<del>n't</del> Care" (Duology).

                    <br> Director: Dave Morris, Nicole Malcolm
                    <br> Tech operation: Belfry theatre
                    <br> Playwrights, Set & Costume Designers: Belfry 101 Students
                    <br> Shows I wrote: "What Can AI Not Do?", "Help! (improvisation)", Monologue of a bullied kid
                    <br> Roles I played: The playwright, The lost girl, the secretary, Sally (the doll), the preppy, the
                    bullied
                    <br>
                    <br> I pitched the general idea of "fire alarm" on the first day of the workshop.
                    <br> I got this idea when experiencing three fire alarm drills in a sequence at our school.
                    <br> The actual reason of fires in whatever bathrooms was never revealed but the question of "why
                    people set fires in school bathrooms?" lingered in my mind.
                    <br> The crowd approved my proposal and each of us created plays and monologues which were
                    eventually put into a sequence of sections.
                    <br> "What Can AI Not Do?" is adapted from my real-life experience and feelings as a content
                    creator. The audience interaction I did in "Help!" was quite a challenge and I never knew what would
                    happened in the next second. There's no rehearsal for that. I am very surprised by the audiences'
                    laughter. Thanks for the generous reaction.

                    <br> 现在会想起排练庄姬的时光，还是会对当初那种纯粹的心境发出感慨。想到当时选角的时期，那好像是我记忆中人生第一次对什么东西会如此执着地和竞争对手暗自较劲。
                    <br> 排练庄姬的一年多时光，必然是我初中三年里的高光之一。至今脑海里都有一个画面如此清晰，是我晚上一个人走在从排练厅回教室的连廊上，一切都如次地安静，我的脚步是如此平稳，静到能听到一种流动的心跳。
                    <br> 还记得有一次排练，演到后面我真的落泪了。情不自禁地。讲实话在比赛现场反倒没有过。准确来说是除那次之外都没有过了。
                    <br> 记得特别清楚的另一件事是孙老师给我们外卖晚饭，我点了大家了的猪排饭，刚打开没吃一口就不小心全倒地上了。我非常非常自责难堪，但孙老师一点指责的神色都没有，二话不说就又帮我点了一份。
                    <br> 想必排练厅就是我的safe space。一切发生在那里的事好像都如此地自然。那里允许一切的发生。
                    <br> 我记得我第一次在市里比赛之前，是完全没想过要拿什么奖，出什么成绩的。现在回想，那时真的是把当时小小的单薄的自己的一切都献给了戏、献给了那一刻、献给了角色。
                    <br> 发出感慨的原因大概是，觉得人生中能有不止一次这样的机会去完全地做自己、被信任，完全地心无旁骛，全身心地为了一件事而不为任何目的地投入和释放，是何等的幸运。
                    <br> 至今都很清楚地记得徐老师说的“凌若瑶你不用告诉她怎么演她就知道怎么演”，和陈锦老师说的“觉得你的眼中看到的都是美好的东西啊”。我想它们会支撑着我走很远。
